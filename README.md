Palindrome Checker
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or any sequence of characters that remains the same when read backwards. Classic examples include:

"madam"

"racecar"

"level" 

This project is a Palindrome Checker developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing the user to type a word or phrase and find out if it is a palindrome.

🚀 Features
✔️ Real-time verification – The system analyzes the entered text and shows the result instantly.
✔️ Ignores spaces and capitalization – The algorithm treats upper/lower case letters and removes spaces for an accurate comparison.
✔️ Responsive design – Works well on mobile and desktop devices.
✔️ Visual feedback – Highlighted in green (if it is a palindrome) or red (if it is not).

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – Web page structure.

CSS – Responsive styling and design.

JavaScript – Palindrome checking logic.

📌 How to Use
Enter a word or phrase in the input field.

The system will automatically check if it is a palindrome.

The result will be displayed below, with indicative colors.
